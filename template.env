# The hostname or IP address on which your server will run.
# * Typically, this is 'localhost' for local development.
# * For production, this should be the public IP address or domain name of your server.
HOST=localhost

# The port number on which your server will run.
# * Typically, this is 8000 for local development, but you might need to change it for production.

# Allowed origins for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).
# This should be a comma-separated list of origins allowed to access your resources.
# * For local development, you might use 'localhost'.

# Connection string for your MongoDB instance.
# * For local development, this is usually something like 'mongodb://HOST:PORT/YOUR_DB_NAME'.
#     â€” In most cases, host is: 'localhost' and the port is: '27017' (without quotes).
# * For production, use your MongoDB Atlas URI or other remote MongoDB service.
MONGODB_CONN=mongodb://localhost:27017/meteor

# Secret key for your application.
# This key is used for signing and verifying tokens (e.g., JWT).
# * For local development, you can use a simple key like 'insecure_secret_key'.
# * For production, generate a strong, unique secret key.
# You can generate a secure key using a command like `openssl rand -base64 32`.
SECRET_KEY=insecure_secret_key
